# RiverGuard UI/UX Design Cheat Sheet

> **Document purpose:** Complete product-flow and screen-planning reference for RiverGuard UI/UX design.
>
> **Status:** Design specification. It includes the current local research prototype and clearly labeled future concepts. It does not mean every screen is implemented.
>
> **Initial study coverage:** Quezon City, Marikina, Manila, and Pasig.

## 1. How to use this document

Use this cheat sheet when creating the sitemap, user flows, low-fidelity wireframes, design system, and high-fidelity Figma screens. It answers:

- Who uses RiverGuard?
- How does each person enter and leave the system?
- Which account, authentication, and onboarding screens are required?
- Which pages can each role access?
- What inputs, buttons, outputs, and states belong on each page?
- Which features belong to the initial prototype and which are future concepts?

### Design-status labels

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Prototype** | Appropriate for the initial local research demonstration. |
| **Optional** | Useful for a richer prototype, but not necessary for the first usable design. |
| **Future** | May be designed now, but requires more data, validation, authentication, infrastructure, or governance before implementation. |

## 2. Product rules that affect every screen

1. RiverGuard is a **research and decision-support prototype**, not an official warning authority.
2. The supplied development data is daily and city-level for Quezon City, Marikina, Manila, and Pasig.
3. Do not present city-level data as barangay-, street-, river-station-, or household-level evidence.
4. Do not claim real-time monitoring when the product is displaying historical records, requested weather forecasts, or experimental model results.
5. Results produced from unverified data must be labeled **Experimental**.
6. Static hazard susceptibility and dynamic forecast results require separate layers, legends, timestamps, and explanations.
7. Unsupported areas show **Unsupported** or **No prediction available**, never an assumed low-risk result.
8. Missing readings remain missing; the interface must not silently display them as zero.
9. Predictions do not replace PAGASA advisories, LGU procedures, professional assessment, or evacuation instructions.
10. Every result should expose its location, valid date, retrieval/creation time, source, model version, quality status, and limitations when available.

## 3. Application roles and account policy

### 3.1 Product roles

| Role | Primary goal | Initial availability |
|---|---|---|
| **Guest / Public Visitor** | View general project information and, in a future public version, supported public outlooks | **Future public experience** |
| **Resident / Public User** | View a simplified location outlook, save preferences, and find official sources | **Future** |
| **Researcher / Data Analyst** | Inspect data, run experimental forecasts, compare runs, and evaluate models | **Prototype primary role** |
| **LGU / DRRMO Operator** | Review forecasts, record assessments, acknowledge items, and prepare controlled alert drafts | **Optional/Future** |
| **System Administrator** | Approve users, assign roles, configure supported locations/providers/models, and review audit history | **Optional/Future** |

Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team are project-delivery roles. They do not automatically need separate application roles. If they use the application, they receive one of the product roles above.

### 3.2 Recommended account rules

- Public information may be browsed without an account in a future hosted version.
- Residents may self-register only for resident features such as saved locations or notification preferences.
- A person must **not** gain Researcher, LGU, or Administrator permissions merely by selecting that role during sign-up.
- Privileged access uses an invitation or an access request that an administrator approves.
- The first administrator is created through a controlled setup process, not public sign-up.
- LGU and Administrator accounts should use multi-factor authentication when authentication is implemented.
- The authentication provider has not yet been selected. Designs should remain provider-neutral.
- Because the current application is local, login/sign-up may remain a designed future flow until account infrastructure is implemented.

### 3.3 Account states

| State | Meaning | User experience |
|---|---|---|
| Guest | Not signed in | Public pages only |
| Unverified | Registered but email/identity not verified | Verification screen; resend option |
| Pending approval | Privileged-role request is awaiting review | Pending page; no protected workspace access |
| Active | Verified and approved where required | Role workspace access |
| Rejected | Access request declined | Neutral status page and support/contact option |
| Suspended | Temporarily blocked by an administrator | Sign-in blocked with a non-sensitive explanation |
| Deactivated | Account access removed | Sign-in blocked; contact administrator |
| Locked | Too many failed attempts or security event | Recovery/unlock guidance |

**Buttons:** `Review Inputs`, `Run Experimental Forecast`, and `Cancel`.

**Validation:** unsupported location, incompatible model, missing required features, provider failure, and unavailable verified station data.

### APP-05 — Forecast progress

Steps: requesting weather → validating inputs → running supported models → saving snapshot → complete/partial/failed.

**Buttons:** `Run in Background` — optional, `Cancel Run` only if safely supported, and `View Partial Details` after partial completion.

### APP-06 — Forecast results

**Header:** run ID, status, times, locations, provider, model version, and quality status.

**Outputs:** seven-day cards, weather inputs, experimental index/category, supported water-level output, evaluated uncertainty, feature contributions, warnings, and explicit unavailable results.

**Buttons:** `View Day`, `View Explanation`, `Compare Run`, `Open on Map`, `Add Review Note`, and future `Export Report`.

Never call an uncalibrated output an exact flood probability.

## 12. Route and permission matrix

| Area | Guest | Resident | Researcher | LGU | Admin |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Public About/Limitations | View | View | View | View | View |
| Simplified public outlook | Future view | Future view | View | View | View |
| Detailed historical data | No | No | View | Assigned view | View |
| Run forecast | No | No | Yes | Optional assigned areas | Configure/optional |
| Model evaluation | No | No | Yes | Summary only | View/configure |

| Model card | Version, purpose, coverage, validation, limitations |
| Chart | Variable, unit, range, source, missing markers, table alternative |
| Map legend | Layer name, meaning, run/date, static/dynamic label |
| Empty state | What is unavailable, why, and what can happen next |
| Confirmation dialog | Exact action, consequence, confirm/cancel controls |
| Stepper | Current authentication/onboarding/forecast step |
| Toast/notification | Brief result; never the only place critical information appears |

## 14. Required system and form states

3. Role-specific onboarding
4. Shared shell and navigation
5. Researcher dashboard and core forecast journey
6. Map, location, data-source, and model-detail screens

8. Resident simplified journey
9. Administrator approval and configuration journey
10. Profile, security, logout, and account lifecycle

The recommended first connected prototype is:

**Welcome → Log In → Researcher Onboarding → Researcher Dashboard → Run Forecast → Progress → Results → Day Detail → Log Out.**

After that path works, adapt the shared system for Resident, LGU, and Administrator flows instead of designing four unrelated products.
